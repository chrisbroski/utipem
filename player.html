<h2>Movement and Distance</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Far away</b> - So far away that nothing can be seen (At another location, somewhere else, back at the ranch, etc.)
<li><b>Distant</b> - Large objects can be seen without detail (In the distance, across the way, just outside, etc.)
<li><b>Medium</b> - People can be seen clearly, but not interacted with without yelling or throwing something. (In the room, within earshot, etc.)
<li><b>Close</b> - At a comfortable talking distance. A quick movement can put the two in contact.
<li><b>Engaged</b> - Things are in contact, wrestling, whispering, etc.
</ol>
<p>One turn of movement can change the distance between you and a target by one level, with the exception of far away. That will depend on how far away you are.
