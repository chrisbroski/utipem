The Adventure Begins
====================

Guy #1 and Guy #2 grew up as friends in a medium sized rural village. They are ready and old enough to leave and seek their fortune, but first, they need some money and supplies. Here are some odd jobs close by.

Farmer Farmer's Deer Problem
----------------------------

"Dang deer keep eatin' my corn crop. Soon there'll barely be enough to harvest. If you boys can scare some away, I'd be grateful. If you can catch any, I'd pay for their carcasses."

Healer's Herbs
--------------

"I am nearly out of bloodwort. It's a common plant that grows in one of the shadier parts of the forest."

(There is a wild pig eating them that will have to be chased away.)

Herb the Healer can train in herbology and all healing skills.

Goblin Thieves
--------------

Upon returning home, several small, ugly humanoids are found rummaging through their belongings. One tries to escape through the window with a small bag of things.

Missing Child
-------------

A 5 year old girl has wandered off. Will you offer your assistance?

Burglary
--------

"You see, this guy stole a ring from me! So if you got it back from him, it really wouldn't be stealing, right? I am certain he keeps it in the trunk by his bed."

Shady guy can train in sneak and follow.

Sparring Partner
----------------

"I am teaching basic dueling to a younger class today. If you helped out, I could pay you a little, and you might even learn something!"

Can train in all weapon skills.
