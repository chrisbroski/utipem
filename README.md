# Utipem

RPG system designed to start fast and play easily

## Purpose

What are the least amount of rules needed to make role-playing games fun without adding undue complexity? All systems I have worked with either go overboard with simulation rules, making character creation and adventuring too much work, or eschew rules altogether, leaving the fate of the players entirely in the hands of the GM. Utipem is project to explore what rules are needed to make tabletop RPGs a true game, with clear rules that can be understood by new players with no more difficulty than most commercial board games.

## Core Rules

**Utipem** is based on cards. This allows the GM to create any subset of the rules in their adventures, and players to only have to focus on the rules that pertain to their characters. Magic the Gathering has shown us that an immensely complex game can be made managable with a core set of rules and instructions for each card clearly explained.

### Character Card

The main card will be a character. There are no "stats", "abilities" or other types of inherent attributes on this card, only descriptive information about the character. The GM could enforce standard information for all characters such as race, age, height, gender and other obvious physical traits. The only piece of information required by the core rules of Utipem is that a character have a unique (meaning no other character in the adventure has it, not that it is weird) name.

The only other requirement for a starting character to choose training in a number of level I skills (typically 5.)

### Turns

The opportunity to take a turn is given to all player characters first, except in the event of an undetected surprise. Once all players have attempted a skill, moved position, or passed their turn, non player characters may act at the GM's discretion. What can happen in a turn is defined on skill cards. Certain actions may trigger immediate types of responses such as dodging, parrying, or counter-attacking.

### Encounters

A situation that requires the players to take turns using skills to solve a problem is called an encounter. It ends when when the problem is resolved or all attempts fail and the players give up.

### Adventures

An adventure is a series of possible encounters created by the GM to form the basis of an interactive story. They may be as small as a handful of encounters, or as big as the GM and players have time for.

### Skill Cards

The main mechanic of Utipem (and where it derives the name) is the skill card. These cards can be acquired at any time except during an active encounter. The effects of these can vary widely, but how they are acquired and improved stays the same.

#### Acquiring Skill Cards

New skills can be learned from a player or non-player character with that skill at a *professional* level or higher. Typically this will take about a day's worth of training and some compensation to the trainer. Most can also be attempted without training, but at a lower success rate.

#### Expertise Levels

A Skill has a maximum of 6 levels of expertise with standard methods of increasing these levels.

##### Untrained

The lowest level of expertise is attempting a skill without any prior training. Any player with the essential prerequisites can attempt any skill at this level.

##### Trained

This level is better that untrained, but not much. The player has no real experience. Skills can reach this level by getting a day's worth of training with a player of *professional* level or higher. A player can also advance to this level from *untrained* by successfully performing the skill during a non-training encounter.

##### Intermediate

Like promotion from *untrained* to *trained*, this skill level is attained when a player successfully performs a skill during a non-training based encounter.

##### Professional

Some skills require expertise in another skill to be at least *intermediate* level. Having one dependant skill at *intermediate* level will promote the prerequisite skill to the *professional* level.

##### Expert

To have an *expert* level skill, a skill needs two dependant skills, at least one at *professional* level.

##### Master

To elevate to *master* expertise a player need at least three dependant skills, with at least one at *expert* level.

#### Card Information

All skill cards must include:

1. A unique name for the skill
2. A type, such as weapon, magic, armor, movement, etc.
3. A level representing how many lower level dependencies are required. I - III
4. A description of its effects
5. A table of effects at each level for at least *untrained*, *trained* and *intermediate* expertise levels.
6. A space after *trained* and *intermediate* to document the success of a skill during an encounter for the date and initials of the supervising GM.
7. Prerequisities to attempt, if any (typically a piece of equipment)
8. Prerequisites to train, if any (usually a more basic type of training)

#### Example Card

    Short Sword  
    Weapon (slashing) I  
    On >= 2d6, deal target damage to a random anatomy.  
    Target gets an opportunity for a defensive maneuver.
    
    U: 9
    T: 8
    I: 7
    P: 6
    E: 5
    M: 4
    
    Attempt prereq: Short sword in hand

What damage and random anatomy are will be explained below.

### Movement and Distance

There are five distances in Utipem:

1. **Far away** (So far away that nothing can be seen)
2. **Distant** (Large objects can be seen without detail)
3. **Medium** (People can be seen clearly, but not intercted with without yelling or throwing something)
4. **Close** (Comfortable talking distance. A quick movement can put the two in touching distance.)
5. **Engaged** (Things are touching, wrestling, whispering, etc.)

One turn can change distance between a player and a target by one level, with the exception of far away. That will depend on how far away they are.

## Combat

The above rules should complete all basic rules needed to play in the Utipem system. They don't yet, because this is a work in progress, but they should. All the GM needs to do is create their adventure and skill cards. Skills can be anything depending on the setting.
