# Utipem

RPG system designed to start fast and play easily

## Purpose

What are the least amount of rules needed to make role-playing games fun without adding undue complexity? All systems I have worked with either go overboard with simulation rules, making character creation and adventuring too much work, or eschew rules altogether, leaving the fate of the players entirely in the hands of the GM. Utipem is project to explore what rules are needed to make tabletop RPGs a true game, with clear rules that can be understood by new players with no more difficulty than most commercial board games.

##Rules So Far

**Utipem** is based on cards. This allows the GM to create any subset of the rules in their adventures, and players to only have to focus on the rules that pertain to their characters.

Magic the Gathering has shown us that an immensely complex game can be made managable with a core set of rules and instructions for each card clearly explained. The main card will be a character. There are no "stats", "abilities" or other types of inherent attributes on this card, only descriptive information about the character. The GM could enforce standard information for all characters such as race, age, height, gender and other obvious physical traits. The only piece of information required by the core rules of Utipem is that a character have a unique (meaning no other chatacter in the adventure has it, not that it is weird) name.
