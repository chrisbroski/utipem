# Utipem

RPG system designed to start fast and play easily

## Purpose

What are the least amount of rules needed to make role-playing games fun without adding undue complexity? All systems I have worked with either go overboard with simulation rules, making character creation and adventuring too much work, or eschew rules altogether, leaving the fate of the players entirely in the hands of the GM. Utipem is project to explore what rules are needed to make tabletop RPGs a true game, with clear rules that can be understood by new players with no more difficulty than most commercial board games.

##Rules So Far

**Utipem** is based on cards. This allows the GM to create any subset of the rules in their adventures, and players to only have to focus on the rules that pertain to their characters. Magic the Gathering has shown us that an immensely complex game can be made managable with a core set of rules and instructions for each card clearly explained.

### Character Card

The main card will be a character. There are no "stats", "abilities" or other types of inherent attributes on this card, only descriptive information about the character. The GM could enforce standard information for all characters such as race, age, height, gender and other obvious physical traits. The only piece of information required by the core rules of Utipem is that a character have a unique (meaning no other character in the adventure has it, not that it is weird) name.

### Turns

The opportunity to take a turn is given to all player characters first, except in the event of an undetected surprise. Once all players have made an action or passed their turn, non player character may act. What can happen in a turn is defined on skill cards.

### Encounters

A situation that requires the players to take turns to use skills in order to solve a problem is called an encounter. It ends when when the problem is resolved or fails.

### Adventures

And adventure is a series of possible encounters created by the GM to tell an interactive story.

### Skill Cards

The main mechanic of Utipem (and where it derives its name) is the skill card. These cards can be acquired at any time except during an encounter. The effects of these can vary widely, but how they are acquired and improved stays the same.

#### Acquiring Skill Cards

New skills can be learned from a player or non-player character with that skill at a Professional level or higher. Typically this will take about a days worth of training and some compensation to the trainer. They can also be attempted without training, but at a lower ability.

#### Expertise Levels

A Skill has a maximum of 6 levels of expertise with standard methods of increasing these levels.

##### Untrained

The lowest level of expertise is attempting a skill without any prior training. Any player with the essential prerequisites can attempt a skill at this level.

##### Trained

This level is better that untrained, but not much. The player has no real experience. Skills can reach this level by getting a day's worth of training with a player of professional level or higher. A player can also advance to this level from *untrained* by performing the skill successfully in a real situation.

##### Intermediate

This skill level is attained when a player uses a skill during a non-training based encounter.

##### Professional

Some skills require intermediate expertise as a prerequisite. Having a dependant skill at intermediate level will promote the prerequisite skill to a professional level.

##### Expert

To have an *expert* level skill, a skill needs two dependant skills, at least one at professional level.

##### Master

To elevate to *master* expertise a player need at least three dependant skill, at least one at expert level.

#### Example Card

A skill card needs:

1. A unique name.
2. A type such as, weapon, magic, armor, magic, etc.
3. A level representing how many lower level dependencies are required. I - III
4. A table of
